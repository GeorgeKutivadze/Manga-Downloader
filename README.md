# Manga-Downloader
The code automatically downloads manga chapters via link and converts all of them into.cbz formats. It also has an update feature for missing or new chapters. It only works on two manga sites (https://m.manganelo.com/ and https://mkklcdnv6tempv3.com/). The code also downloads cover images from https://mangadex.org/. The code can't download images (manga chapter) if the site doesn't mention chapter, and it can also download missing or corrupt image files if the site has no images. The code switches servers in the event of a corrupt, missing, or inaccessible image.
